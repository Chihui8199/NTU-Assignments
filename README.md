| [CZ3001](https://github.com/Chihui8199/NTU-Assignments/tree/master/CZ3001%20Advanced%20Computer%20Architecture)| Advanced Computer Architecture|Verilog & CUDA</br></br> Lovely prof, Prof Smitha! Enjoyed this mod cause the prof is super good. Otherwise, the content is kind of dry. |
| [CZ3002](https://github.com/Chihui8199/NTU-Assignments/tree/master/CZ3002%20Advanced%20Software%20Engineering/Project%20Submission)| Advanced Software Engineering<br/><br/>[GoldFolks](https://github.com/Chihui8199/CZ3002-GoldFolks-Application.git)|Flutter</br></br> Not useful at all, tons of documentation to do that follows templates created in the 2000s? - still don't see the purpose. NTU still uses SVN lol.|
| [CZ3003](https://github.com/Chihui8199/NTU-Assignments/tree/master/CZ3003%20Software%20System%20Design%20and%20Analysis)|Software System Analysis and Design<br/><br/>[HUF](https://github.com/Song0180/CZ3003-HUF.git)<br/><br/>[Video](https://github.com/Song0180/CZ3003-HUF.git)|React.js & Django</br></br>Take this mod seriously and you might learn some really interesting SE things and technologies. |
| [EG0001](https://github.com/Chihui8199/NTU-Assignments/tree/master/EG0001%20Engineers%20and%20Society) | Engineers and Society| Pretty fun mod for me, got to present on some really interesting topics. Helps that a few of my classmates were BCG students, that took our discussion to the next level. Not v useful as  a mod though >.<|
| [CZ3004]()| Multidisciplinary Project<br/><br/>[Lightning McQueen](https://github.com/Chihui8199/CZ3004-Multipdisciplinary-Project.git)<br/><br/>[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4bDsNanIgQ)|Python & Android Studio</br></br> Just meh pray for good group mates. Robot guy make or break it.|
| [CZ4067]() |Software Security|Pretty Interesting module, with CTF component. Highly recommended if you're interested in security. But...don't take this as you first security mod, did that and had to study harder. Pretty content heavy and dry but it's doable. Painful at the start, enjoyable when you understand stuff.|
| [CZ3005]() |Artificial Intelligence|Python & Prolog. First part feels like a refresher on algorithms. Second part, prof seemed to be speaking ailien language. Have fun learning Prolog. Mug your PYPs!|
|**Business**|||
|[MKT1705X](https://github.com/Chihui8199/NTU-Assignments/tree/master/MKT1705X%20Marketing)|Marketing(NUS)||
|[AB0602](https://github.com/Chihui8199/NTU-Assignments/tree/master/AB0602%20Communications%20Management%20Strategy)| Communication Management Strategy|As with any communication module, not so easy to score...Very useful skills learnt though|
|[BC2410]()|Prescriptive Analytics: From Data to Decision | Optimisation Modules  in Python (RSOME & Gurobi Module)</br></br>Interesting Module, heavy on linear algebra and math. Pretty useful and awesome prof. Prof Qinshen is one of the most enthusiastic prof. Helps that he came from NUS haha|
|[BC3402]()|Financial Service Analytics |Interesting module that covers what happens in the entire trade cycle. Personally difficult to score for me, a lot more qualitative (lots of essay) than quantitative.|
