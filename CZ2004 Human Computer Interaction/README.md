# CZ2004 Multiversal Studio
This project contains a low fidelity & high fidelity prototype of a kiosk (about 1.4m by 1m). The kiosk is for an imaginary amusement park called Multiversal Studios. The kiosk serves as a way for visitors to learn about the park and plan what activities they should take part in. This is a school project I did for CZ2004 Human Computer Interaction.
