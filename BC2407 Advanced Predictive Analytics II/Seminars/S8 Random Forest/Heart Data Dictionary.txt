Context:
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers todate. The "target" field AHD refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
