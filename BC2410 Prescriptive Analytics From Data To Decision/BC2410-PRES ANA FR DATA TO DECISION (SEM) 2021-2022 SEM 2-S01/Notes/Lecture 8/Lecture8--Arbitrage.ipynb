    "The foreign exchange market includes the trading of currencies. It is one of the markets with largest trading volume. Given two currencies at any particular time, say the US dollar and the euro, there are two exchange rates between them: one dollar will buy $r_1$ euros, and one euro will buy $r_2$ dollars. It is evident that an arbitrage opportunity would arise if $r_1 r_2 > 1$ since one could simultaneously convert 1 dollar into $r_1$ euros and the $r_1$ euros into $r_1 r_2 > 1$ dollars. These two transactions would net $r_1 r_2 − 1$ dollars without any risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting related question is: Can one detect a similar type of arbitrage opportunity involving more than two currencies? In particular, consider the following hypothetical exchange rates among the currencies USD (US Dollars), EUR (Euros), GBP (British Pounds), AUD (Australian Dollars), and JPY (Japanese Yen).\n",
